# This will generate multiple output files
# output-0.pdf, output-1.pdf
# The +repage is needed to make each piece from the poster to occupy a full page.
# Otherwise each piece will be a blank copy of the poster, with that piece in its original position.
# -density 190 controls the quality of the pdf. The default value ruins the quality.
convert -density 190 poster.pdf -crop 25%x25% +repage output.pdf


# The resulting pages probably won't print correctly in A4 papers
# I suggest that you add some border, and then use another software to "print to file"
#   while setting "fit to printable area" option.
